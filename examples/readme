This is a collection of scripts used to grade
the first assignment in CSCE 155H/RAIK 183H
in Fall 2015.  The main scripts are grade.php
and grade.team.php which include the other
scripts, one for each problem.  The assignment
is included (hw01.pdf) for reference.  

The scripts use the grading framework classes
defined in grade.inc.php (TestSuite, TestModule,
and TestCase).  The script generates HTML output
and includes collapsible div elements for 
convenience.
